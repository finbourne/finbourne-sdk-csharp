# Finbourne.Sdk.Lusid.Model.FxForwardsDependency

Indicates a dependency on an FxForwardCurve.  Identical to Fx dependencies in the meaning of domestic and foreign currencies, but describes a *set* of fx rates.  These rates are quoted rates for fx forwards, which can be used to interpolate the forward rate at a specific time in the future.  In the case of pips, the absolute rates can be expressed as rate = spotFx + pips / pipsPerUnit

## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **DomesticCurrency** | **string** | Required | DomesticCurrency is the first currency in a currency pair quote e.g. eur-gbp, eur is the domestic currency. |
| **ForeignCurrency** | **string** | Required | ForeignCurrency is the second currency in a currency pair quote e.g. eur-gbp, gbp is the foreign currency. |
| **CurveType** | **string** | Required | Used to describe the format in which the curve is expressed  e.g. FxFwdCurve (general term to describe any representation), TenorFxFwdCurve, PipsFxFwdCurve. |
| **Date** | **DateTimeOffset** | Required | The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date. |
| **DependencyType** | **string** | Required | The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency Default: `DependencyTypeEnum.FxForwardsDependency` |


## Usage

### Creating an instance

```csharp
using Finbourne.Sdk.Services.Lusid.Model;

var instance = new FxForwardsDependency(
    domesticCurrency: "...",  // required — DomesticCurrency is the first currency in a currency pair quote e.g. eur-gbp, eur is the domestic currency.
    foreignCurrency: "...",  // required — ForeignCurrency is the second currency in a currency pair quote e.g. eur-gbp, gbp is the foreign currency.
    curveType: "...",  // required — Used to describe the format in which the curve is expressed  e.g. FxFwdCurve (general term to describe any representation), TenorFxFwdCurve, PipsFxFwdCurve.
    date: DateTimeOffset.Now,  // required — The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date.
    dependencyType: "..."  // required — The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency
);
```
### Serializing to JSON

```csharp
var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(instance, Formatting.Indented);
```

### Deserializing from JSON

```csharp
var instance = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<FxForwardsDependency>(json);
```
