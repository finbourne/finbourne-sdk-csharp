## Usage

### Creating an instance

```csharp
using Finbourne.Sdk.Services.Lusid.Model;

var instance = new ForwardRateAgreement(
    startDate: DateTimeOffset.Now,  // required — The settlement date of the FRA
    maturityDate: DateTimeOffset.Now,  // required — The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates beyond their last payment date.
    domCcy: "...",  // required — The domestic currency of the instrument.
    fixingDate: DateTimeOffset.Now,  // required — The date at which the rate to be paid, the reference rate, is confirmed/observed.
    fraRate: 0.0d,  // required — The rate at which the FRA is traded.
    notional: 0.0d,  // required — The amount for which the FRA is traded.
    indexConvention: new IndexConvention(...),  // optional
    timeZoneConventions: new TimeZoneConventions(...),  // optional
    instrumentType: "..."  // required — The available values are: QuotedSecurity, InterestRateSwap, FxForward, Future, ExoticInstrument, FxOption, CreditDefaultSwap, InterestRateSwaption, Bond, EquityOption, FixedLeg, FloatingLeg, BespokeCashFlowsLeg, Unknown, TermDeposit, ContractForDifference, EquitySwap, CashPerpetual, CapFloor, CashSettled, CdsIndex, Basket, FundingLeg, FxSwap, ForwardRateAgreement, SimpleInstrument, Repo, Equity, ExchangeTradedOption, ReferenceInstrument, ComplexBond, InflationLinkedBond, InflationSwap, SimpleCashFlowLoan, TotalReturnSwap, InflationLeg, FundShareClass, FlexibleLoan, UnsettledCash, Cash, MasteredInstrument, LoanFacility, FlexibleDeposit, FlexibleRepo
